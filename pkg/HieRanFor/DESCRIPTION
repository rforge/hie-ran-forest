Description: The package runs randomForest as the lcoal classifciation algorithm for each parent node along a pre-defined hierarhcial tree like class strucutre. 
     The proportion of votes for the terminal nodes of the class strucutre are estimates in two ways: 
     1. step-wise majority rule- starting from the tree root, each cell is classifed to the child with the highest proportion of votes until a terminal node is reached
     2. multiplicative majority rule - the proportion of votes are multiplied along each path from the tree root to each terminal node
     The package also returns several flat and hierarchical performance indices
