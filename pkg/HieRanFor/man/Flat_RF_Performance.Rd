  ntree = Hie_RF$call$ntree, importance = Hie_RF$call$importance,
  proximity = Hie_RF$call$proximity, keep.forest = Hie_RF$call$keep.forest,
  keep.inbag = Hie_RF$call$keep.inbag, Per_Index = c("Flat_Measures",
  "Hie_F_Measure"), Crisp_Rule = c("Multiplicative_Majority",

}
\arguments{
\item{Hie_RF}{Object of class Hier.Random.Forest - the output of
Run_HRF.}

\item{mtry}{Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates
at each split. Default is to use the same method used in Hie_RF}

\item{ntree}{Number of trees to grow in the flat classifier.See
?randomForest for additional details, Default is the same ntree used in
each local classifer of Hie_RF.}

\item{importance}{Logical, if TRUE importance of variables will be
assesed. See ?randomForest for additional details.Default is the same as
Hie_RF.}

\item{proximity}{Logical, If TRUE, proximity will be calcualted. See
?randomForest for additional details. Default is the same as Hie_RF.}

\item{keep.forest}{Logical, if TRUE (recommended) the forest will be
retained. Default is the same as Hie_RF.}

\item{keep.inbag}{Logical, if TRUE an n by ntree matrix be returned
that keeps track of which samples are "in-bag” in which trees. n being the
number of cases in the training set. Required for the permutation-based
performance assesments. Default is the same as Hie_RF.}

\item{Per_Index}{The performance and accuracy indices to compute.
See details in HRF_Performance.}

\item{Crisp_Rule}{The method of translating proportion of votes to a
crisp category. See details in HRF_Performance.}

\item{Perm_Num}{Integer, number of random permutations for each
case if 'Multiplicative_Permutation' is applied. See details in
HRF_Performance.}

\item{By_Node}{Logical, if TRUE, performance measures are
estimated for each terminal node as well.}

\item{Div_Logical}{Logical, if TRUE progress when
'Multiplicative_Permutation' is applied will be printed every Div_Print
permutations}

\item{Beta_H_F}{Numeric in the range Beta_H_F>=0. Controls weights
in the hierarchical F measure index. See Hie_F_Measure for details.}

\item{...}{Optional parameters to be passed to the low level
  functions}
