\title{HieRanFor: A package for running a hierarchical randomFroest analysis.}
\description{
Runs randomForest as the local classification algorithm for
each parent node along a pre-defined hierarchical tree like class structure.
Contains a predict and plot functions and calculation of various flat and
hierarchical performance measures. Further contains predict and performance
function for new data and performance assessment for flat
classification. \cr

\section{Definitions}{

{\tabular{lll}{
\emph{class hierarchy}      \tab \tab A tree structure containing the tree
root and all the internal nodes and terminal nodes. In \code{HieRanFor}, the
class structure should be a directed tree with directions pointing from nodes
closer to the tree root to those further down the hierarchy. Furthermore,
each node may have only one parent node. See the figure below for an example
of the class hierarchy of the \code{'\link{OliveOilHie}'} dataset.\cr

\emph{hierarchical level}   \tab \tab An integer specifying the distance from
the tree root. Each hierarchal level contains a set of nodes within the same
distance from the tree root. Nodes in the same hierarchical level cannot be
linked directly to one another in a tree like class hierarchy. e.g., 'L0',
'L1', 'L2' and 'L3' in the figure.\cr

\emph{node}                 \tab \tab A class in the class hierarchy. e.g.,
'Umbria' or 'Aqulia' in the figure. \cr

\emph{tree root}            \tab \tab The node at the lowest hierarchical
level of the class hierarchy. The only node that has no parent node. All
other nodes are descended from the tree root node. e.g., 'TREE.ROOT' in the
figure \cr

\emph{internal node}         \tab \tab A node that has at least one children
node. e.g., 'Aqulia'. \cr

\emph{terminal node}         \tab \tab A node that has no children nodes.
e.g., 'Umbria'. \cr

\emph{parent node}           \tab \tab The linked node one level closer to
the tree root from a focal node. In a tree like class structure, each
internal or terminal node have a single parent node. e.g., for the focal node
'Calabria, the parent node is 'South'.\cr

\emph{children node}         \tab \tab A linked node one level below a focal
node in the class structure. All internal nodes have at least one children
node. Terminal nodes hav no child nodes. e.g., for the parent node 'South'
the children nodes are 'Aquila', ' Calabria' and 'Sicily'. \cr

\emph{sibling nodes}         \tab \tab All nodes that have the same parent
node. e.g., 'Aquila', ' Calabria' and 'Sicily'.\cr

\emph{tree depth}            \tab \tab The number of hierarchical levels in
the class hierarchy where the tree root is considered as level 0. The tree
depth of the figure below is 3. \cr

\emph{path}                  \tab \tab A linked sequence of nodes starting
from the tree root, moving uni-directionally and ending at a terminal node.
e.g., 'Tree.ROOT' --> 'Sardinia' --> ' Sardinia.inland'. \cr

\emph{flat classification}   \tab \tab A classification in which all terminal
nodes are considered to be in hierarchical level 1 (i.e., children nodes of
the tree root). A flat classification will classify all the terminal nodes in
a single local classifier, ignoring the class hierarchy. \cr

\emph{hierarchical classification}   \tab \tab A classification in which at
least one terminal node is from hierarchical level > 1 (i.e., there is at
least one internal node). In the figure below, 6 local classifiers are
required to run a single hierarchical classification.\cr

\emph{local classifier}      \tab \tab A single flat classification within an
hierarchical classification. A local classifier is a randomForest algorithm
that classifies all the children nodes of a given parent node. e.g., the
local classifier 'C.6' classifies 'Linguria.east' and 'Linguria.west' --> the
children nodes of 'Linguria'. \cr

\emph{case}                  \tab \tab A single data point in the training
data or new data. \cr

\emph{vote}                  \tab \tab The output of a single classification
tree in a single local classifier for a single case. See
\code{\link{randomForest}} for more details. \cr
